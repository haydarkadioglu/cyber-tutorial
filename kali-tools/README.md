ifconfig              # (Deprecated) Show network interfaces
ip route show         # Display routing table

ping 8.8.8.8          # Send ICMP packets to test connection
traceroute google.com # Trace the route to a host
arp -a                # List devices on the local network
netstat -tulnp        # Show open ports and services
ss -tulnp             # Alternative to netstat (faster)

ðŸ“Œ 6. DNS Lookup & Resolution

nslookup google.com   # Find the IP of a domain
dig google.com        # Detailed DNS lookup
host google.com       # Quick DNS resolution

ðŸ“Œ 7. Managing Processes & Services

ps aux                # List all running processes
top                   # Show real-time system usage
htop                  # Advanced process viewer (if installed)
kill <PID>            # Kill a process by ID
pkill firefox         # Kill a process by name

systemctl start apache2   # Start a service
systemctl stop apache2    # Stop a service
systemctl restart ssh     # Restart a service
systemctl enable apache2  # Enable a service at startup
systemctl disable apache2 # Disable a service at startup

ðŸ“Œ 8. Disk & Memory Management

df -h                 # Show disk usage (in GB/MB)
du -sh /var           # Show folder size
mount                 # Show mounted disks

free -h               # Show RAM usage
vmstat 5              # System performance every 5 seconds

ðŸ“Œ 9. Log Analysis

cat /var/log/syslog    # Show system logs
tail -f /var/log/auth.log   # Monitor authentication logs
journalctl -xe         # Show detailed logs

ðŸ“Œ 10. File Permissions & Ownership

ls -l file.txt        # Show file permissions
chmod 777 file.txt    # Give full permissions (Risky!)
chmod 644 file.txt    # Read-only for others
chown root:root file.txt  # Change file owner

ðŸ“Œ 11. Cryptography (Hashing & Encryption)

echo -n "password123" | md5sum    # Generate an MD5 hash
echo -n "password123" | sha256sum # Generate a SHA-256 hash

gpg -c secret.txt    # Encrypt a file (will ask for a password)
gpg secret.txt.gpg   # Decrypt the file
